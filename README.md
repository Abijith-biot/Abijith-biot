KSQ - Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers? 


Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

Take the KSQ and break it down into its constituent components. Test your own understanding of each component. Find additional resources to bolster your understanding.

For example, you might ask: What are cancer cell lines? Why do we use cancer cell lines? And you might find:

Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.

For example, you might ask: What is single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)? Why do we use scRNA-seq data in cancer drug development? And you might find:

How 10x Genomics scRNA-seq technology works
Article about Aviv Regev’s AACR 2024 plenary lecture, “From Cell Atlases to Medicines”
Aviv Regev’s 2022 presentation on cell atlases as roadmaps to understand and treat cancer

What else might you ask to break down the KSQ? What other additional papers/blogs/resources can you find to strengthen your understanding of the KSQ?

Write a Memo
After you have broken down the KSQ and read up on relevant resources, write a concise memo to yourself that does at least the following:

Paraphrase in your own words what the KSQ is asking.
List the helpful resources you have identified in the previous section with any notes you took for yourself.
Note the elements of the KSQ that are still unclear to you.

Add your memo to your GitHub page and provide the link to your GitHub page in our Discord server. Your memo can be uploaded to GitHub as a PDF or in README.md.

Memos Drive Clarity
I am asking you to write a memo to yourself because compbio work is complex, and it is easy to get lost. I want the memo to be a tool that helps you clarify your understanding of the work as it unfolds in the coming weeks. When you leave work on Friday and come back on Monday, you should be able to skim through your memo and instantly know where you left off. If someone, such as your supervisor, asks you for a project update, you should be able to pull out your memo and give a concise update instantly. When you are lost in the weeds of data exploration, you should be able to refer back to your memo to get yourself back on track. As you work on your project in the coming weeks, you should update this memo to reflect your developing/changing understanding of the KSQ.

I cannot overstate the importance of having clarity when you work. This is true not just of compbio jobs in biotech/pharma; it's true of pretty much every job. Writing memos drives clarity.

I now share my favorite work mantra: It's not real if it's not written.
